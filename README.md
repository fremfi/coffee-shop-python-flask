# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree - IAM Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

This application does the following:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

### Tech Stack

Our tech stack will include:

* **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
* **Sqlite** as our database of choice
* **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
* **Ionic** for the website's frontend

### Development Setup

Available on the README.md file inside the backend and frontend folders
